## Training to Complete

Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial has become a widely recognized resource for developers of all skill levels. While the tutorial starts with foundation Rails, it also addresses Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a core skill from the very beginning. Hartl will re-teach you Rails from the ground up with a whole new level of discipline.
