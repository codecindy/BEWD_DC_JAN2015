<h1>About us</h1>

<br>

<p>We're a staff of ideologically agnostic political junkies dedicated to banishing spin from the news. Get to know us better.</p>

<h2> T. Party </h2>
<p>A libertarian graduate of Liberty University, Ms. Party learned spin at Jerry Falwell's knee but got fed up during Pat Robertson's last presidential campaign. She still loves her Fox TV but she can tell Bill O'Reilly from a war correspondent.</p>

<br>

<h2>Loon E. Left</h2>
<p>Mr. Left got his start in politics in the Howard Dean campaign and helped do microtargeting for Obama. He thinks there's got to be a better source for news than Jon Stewart and The Ed Show.</p>S
