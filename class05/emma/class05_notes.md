inheritance = passed down through architecture 

< indicates a subclass 
	class Bender < Robot 
	end 
	*Bender is a child class and therfore inherits the robot class methods

	Bender is a Robot, but Robot is not Bender 


super() - call up the initialize method - aka runs the original and then the new modified version overrides what is left
