# Problem Modeling

### Learning Objectives

- Break down a complex problem:
  - Identify major roles within a scenario.
  - Identify what data is being managed, and who manages it.
  - Consider how roles interact and communicate.
  - Map out workflows, data transactions, and problem state.
- Think about real-world scenarios *as data*.
- Think about *thinking about* problems.

### Tips

- Don't get hung up on code… these are PHYSICAL problems, with physical data.
- There are no wrong answers… this exercise is about *conceptualizing*.
- Write down/diagram everything you can. We want to see your thought process.
- In some cases, *the problem itself* may assume a role in managing data for the problem.

# Entity-Relationship Diagram

* data separate from behavior
* one to one
* one to many
* sequenced by id
* pointers to values in other tables
* join table

# Modeling

1. Name your purpose
2. List possible:
  * Entities (Nouns)
  * Attributes (Adjectives)
  * Relationships
  * Reduce unnecessary entities
  * Behaviors (verbs)
3. Implement
