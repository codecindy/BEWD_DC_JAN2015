# BEWD Final Project

## 1) Proposal (due on 3/23)

Write a 2-3 sentence description of your proposed project, including the APIs and gems you plan on using. Please submit it through [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pnGlWiyWm7wpmw7oLPzDXoXvM4l6obMyG5l779gtgkw/viewform?usp=send_form).

It's okay if your app evolves from this initial description. This is just a starting point for the instructional team to offer feedback on. Please submit this BEFORE class on 3/23 so we have a chance to review your proposal and offer some feedback.

## 2) Requirements (due on 4/1)

**Build a *working* Rails app:**

- Include at least one model.
- Include an API, or a login system, or both!
- Deploy the app to Heroku.
- Repo on GitHub, with a README file.

**Your README should document:**

- A description of the project.
- Setup instructions.
- Gems used.

## Additional Information

### Best Practices

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Code organization (follows Rails conventions)
- Code formatting (whitespace, indentation, etc.)
- Make it look pretty (not required, but encouraged!)


### Tips for Success

- Research your potential API sources sooner rather than later. Find out what is *actually* possible using data available. 

- Start simple and add features as time allows.

- It's more important to make something simple and functional, rather than big (or pretty) and disfunctional.
